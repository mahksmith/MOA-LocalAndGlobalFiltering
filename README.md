MOA-LocalAndGlobalFiltering
===========================

http://www.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/ICDM.2008.45

The project for COMP423. For anyone looking, the majority of my work is in:
  MOA-LgF/src/moa/streams/filters/LocalGlobalFiltering.java

For data-mining, the results that I achieved were different to the results found in the paper. The filter
I created achieved no better than chance, but I couldn't use the exact same data that the paper used.
